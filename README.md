## Project Description

1. What is the purpose of your research project?

  > The purpose of our research project is to understand how and **why the Japanese are able to live so long and have the highest life expectancy in the whole entire world**. The dataset that we have found contains the lifestyle of middle-aged and elderly people of Japanese descent. Through health checkups and visits to the doctors, they were able to gather lifestyle and personal details such as their BMI, the diet of said participants and any occurrences of health issues. Lifestyle factors include any instances of fast eating, skipping breakfast, eating a midnight snack, smoking, alcohol drinking, doing exercise, active lifestyle, and biophysical status were age, height, weight, BMI, blood components, and medical examination history. After we filter through the dataset and do some calculations, we will figure out as to what we as humans can do to live a healthier life through our lifestyle.

2. What other research has been done in this area? Make sure to include 3+ links to related works.

  > Some other research that we have done in this area of the topic is by looking up the **usual life expectancy of Japanese People**. Through this site https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/japan-has-highest-life-expectancy-any-major-country-why-n130871, we learn that the usual diet of a Japanese person is considered to be “The iPod of food”, which concentrates on the magnificent energy of food into a compact and pleasurable size. For a human, the food lifestyle is important to consider in order to live a healthy life.

  > We also weren’t really sure as to **what an HbA1c level is**, so we had to do some research on it to which we stumbled onto this site: https://www.diabetes.co.uk/what-is-hba1c.html which gave us a clear description of what exactly HbA1c is.

  > Research has been done in the area of lifestyle and life expectancy. Some of the related research we found relevant to our project are:

  1. Does Physical Activity Increase Life Expectancy? A Review of the Literature -  The purpose of this article was to synthesize the literature on **life expectancy in relation to physical activity**. A systematic PubMed search on life expectancy in physically active and inactive individuals was performed. In addition, articles comparing life expectancy of athletes compared to that of non athletes were reviewed. The results from this study suggest that regular physical activity increases life expectancy but it is unclear if high intensity sports activities further increase life expectancy.

  2. **Associations of Lifestyle Behavior and Healthy Aging** in Five Latin American and the Caribbean Countries—A 10/66 Population-Based Cohort Study - This research examines the associations of  lifestyle behaviors with healthy aging in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Peru, Mexico and Puerto Rico. Four healthy behaviors were measured: Physical activity, non-smoking, moderate drinking and fruits or vegetables consumption. People engaging in physical activity and consuming fruits or vegetables had increased odds of healthy aging. The findings highlight the importance of awareness of a healthy lifestyle behavior among older people. Link to article: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6266391/

  3. **Influence of Individual and Combined Healthy Behaviors on Successful Aging** - This research examined the extent to which healthy behaviors in midlife, separately and in combination, predict successful aging. The authors used a prospective cohort design involving 5100 men and women aged 42-63 years. The findings are that although individual healthy behaviors are moderately associated with successful aging, their combined impact is substantial.

3. What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.

  > Our dataset consists of data collected from **middle-aged and elderly Japanese over a span of three years through health check-ups between the years of 2012 and 2014**. During this time the life expectancy of Japanese people is 83.10 (2012) and 83.59 (2014). The people who collected the data had a hypothesis that assumed two hours or lower duration between dinner and bedtime can have an influence on increasing the HbA1c level. So the people who collected the data documented their lifestyle factors and miscellaneous information. Lifestyle factors include two-hour duration between dinner and bedtime, fast eating, skipping breakfast, eating a midnight snack, smoking, alcohol drinking, doing exercise, active lifestyle, and biophysical status were age, height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood components, and medical examination history. The result of their hypothesis is that The duration between dinner and bedtime did not significantly affect on HbA1c level. The finding was variated by some lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol drinking and BMI status. Rather than the duration of dinner and bedtime, people should pay more attention to healthy components of last and adequate sleeping time for maintaining a stable metabolic process.

4. Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences.

  > The target audience for our research can **extend around the world**. It is a known fact that Japan has the highest life expectancy, so it would be wise for the rest of the world to observe them and figure out their secrets if they would like to live a longer life. But our goal is to help the people at home first, so our target is the people at the University of Washington. If we are able to figure out some ground-breaking information, we hope it will be able to help DAWGS live a happy healthy life!

5. What should your audience learn from your resource? Please consider specific questions that your project can answer using the data you have identified (that are related to the overarching purpose)

  > From our resource, the audience should be able to identify the different lifestyle factors that contribute to the long life expectancy of Japanese people. The specific questions that our project can answer using the data we have identified are:

  1. How does one’s **different eating styles**, such as fast eating, skipping breakfast and eating midnight snack **contribute to healthy aging**?

  2. How is **physical activity associated with life expectancy**?

  3. Which **lifestyle factor** causes more harm to health **among smoking and alcohol drinking**?

  4. Which **lifestyle factor** among eating healthy, physical activity, no smoking and alcohol drinking **contributes most to life expectancy**?

## Technical Description

1. What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?

  > We will be using **.Rmd** file or **Shiny** app to deploy our final product.

2. Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?

  > We are anticipating some technical difficulties since the dataset is huge and might have hidden data structures that need to be unnested.

  > We also might need to find additional datasets to reach a better conclusion, if the current dataset we are using doesn’t have adequate supporting evidence. We anticipate that it will be **hard to find datasets** that are closely relevant to the current one since the **data** comes from a survey conducted to **answer a specific question**.

3. What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?

  > We will need to learn how to use any **new packages or libraries** that we will utilize to conduct any data analysis and present our results and conclusions as visual representations.

4. What major challenges do you anticipate?

  > Because we are specifically targeting at analyzing and drawing observations from the Japanese population, it might be difficult for us to **find other datasets** that contain data specifically **for this population**.

  > We expect to conduct a lot of **data wrangling** with the huge dataset we found. It contains a relatively large number of columns that we need to take the time to examine and understand, as well as making sure if they are appropriate to use for our specific type of data analysis.

  > We also expect to encounter a lot of problems on having **meet ups that fit all group members’ schedule** since we all have different activities and things going on outside of classes. We will make an effort to set up a consistent range of time specifically every week to work on this project.

  > All group members will be working and contributing to the same repository on GitHub, so we will most likely encounter some kind of **merge conflicts** or problems with different machines working together. We will communicate with one another before and during the working process consistently to avoid complicating the problems if possible.
