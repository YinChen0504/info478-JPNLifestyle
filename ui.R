                                  A greater number of years to live implies that a person has to live a relatively healthy lifestyle without performing many risky behaviors, such as smoking,

                                  30 minutes than that of the US, meaning that people in Japan were more physically active than people in the US. Looking at the physical exercise factor broken 
                                  down by ages, we can see that people in all age groups in Japan were more physically active than that of the US. The most active age group in the US was 70+, 
                                  while for Japan it was the 60-69 year-old age group. In general, older people in both countries exercised more, it is perhaps due to the fact that they had more 
                                  time to exercise than younger people, or that they realized the importance of exercise to better body health. It is a common knowledge that physical exercise is 
                                  significant in maintaining physical health, especially for older people, the more active they remain, the healthier their bodies will be, therefore leading to a

                                  males, the average number of drinks consumed by the US was greater than that of Japan. The data files we used only contain people with age from 40 to 70+,

                                  influencing a personâ€™s physical health, in more serious cases, it directly impacts the number of years a person lives, we can say that Japan having a long

                                  reported getting less than 30 minutes of exercise per day. Whereas, in Japan; almost 50% of the surveyed people reported of exercising for more than 30 minutes per
